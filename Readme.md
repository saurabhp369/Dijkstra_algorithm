Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for a Point Robot(Path Planning)

Workspace is an 8 connected space, that means the robot can move up, down, left, right & diagonally between up-left, up-right, down-left and down-right directions.

To run the code:
    python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-Saurabh-Palande.py
